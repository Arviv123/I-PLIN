Instructions for uploading to GitHub:

1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository named: iplan-mcp-server
2. Make it public
3. Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
4. Copy the repository URL (should look like: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iplan-mcp-server.git)

Then run these commands in your terminal:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iplan-mcp-server.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.
